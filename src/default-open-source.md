# Default Open Source

Back in the day I worked for a company that defaulted to the public bit is on for GitHub repositories. It was largely a symbolic gesture of "Open Source" since we didn't (usually) attempt to create a community around the source, provide timely review of the occassional pull requests, or respond to issues. Years later, I still get tagged on an issue as a "recent" contributor. Despite our lack of commitment to community building, this still felt like the "right" thing to do. 

Feelings matter. In retrospect, this 1-bit contributed more positive company culture than virtually any other effort. The management team that allowed this practice recognized that the value the company was providing *wasn't* code. The value was our passion for making customers happy. 

That probably feels insincere, but I mean it. The product we provided was uptime. The product we provided was a dedication to making our customers successful. This came in the form of 3AM pages, an extremely talented support organization, and a product that most of us _wanted_ to actually use.

The code was "just" a means to an end.
