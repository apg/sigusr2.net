# "Senior" Software Engineers

I used to work with someone, who as a defence mechanism, would always say "This idea is terrible, but `$X`." And you know what? Some of her ideas _were_ terrible. Some of them were great, too!

When I think about what it means to be a "senior" software engineer, I think the most important aspect of the job is being able to take an idea and dissect it as quickly as possible. Get an understanding of the trade offs and benefits.

To do this, you might pattern match against personal experiences and other, applicable, experience reports (e.g. journals, blogs, etc). This isn't valid in only software. No, I think this is *generally* applicable. It might also imply why that first "[10,000 hours](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26384712)" is so important.

Anyway, the trick is to ignore this notion that an unexplored idea is somehow "good" or "bad." An unexplored idea is just that--an unexplored idea. So, explore it. Then decide.
