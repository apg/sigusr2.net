I'm [Andrew][andrew].

I've worn a number of hats over the years[^1], and currently
build distributed logging and metrics tools at [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

There's a million [projects][projects] that I'd like to get to, and a mess of
experiments that'll just have to wait...

I've given a few talks over the years at various local meetups,
presented numerous times at [Hack and Tell][handt], and spoke at the
first [!!Con][bangbangcon], in 2014.

[^1]: But for some reason, never a fedora, or fez.
