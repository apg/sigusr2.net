To which I say, "phooey."

Though, I would never claim to be a design "guru" or of any high authority to
decide "what makes good design", I do know one thing for sure. If enough sites
have a similar style, use similar design elements such as bold colors,
gradients, drop shadows, lots of contrast, etc, etc, etc, it's probably safe
to categorize them.

Now, because a plethora of "Web 2.0" services popped up, all using similar
design style, does that mean that other non-services such as blogs, or project
sites can't use those design elements? Of course not. So, why can't "Web 2.0
Design" be used to label those sites that adopt those design elements?

I say it can. But, Who am I? Nobody. I think someone out there that is someone
can back me up on this and either, acknowledge the influx of people using
these "trendy web 2.0esque" and coin a new term for it, or help make those who
oppose comply with what is obvious.
