With all this talk of malware immunity and the [iLife][1] apps, everybody
seems to have left out the one feature of OS X that has prevented me from
switching to Linux for development. No, it isn't because I am locked into
iTunes - though I am.

I'm talking about the most addictive, most over-looked and under-rated feature
of OS X - the reason I feel claustrophobic when I'm stuck writing .NET on a
Windows box.

I'm talking about [Expose] (http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/).

Expose is a window management tool in OS X. It can be bound to keystrokes,
mouse-button clicks, and corners of the screen. Upon activation, Expose will
either (a) show your desktop, (b) tile all of your application windows into
the visible area allowing you to select one, or (c) tile all of the windows of
the currently active application.

This might seem simple. You may think I'm too excited over a stupid little
feature. In any case, if you ever get the chance to spend some time with a
Mac, I highly recommend experimenting with Expose. Find a configuration that
fits the way you work and just go with it for a few days. When you get back to
your Windows or Linux environment, I'm betting you'll feel as claustrophobic
as I do.
