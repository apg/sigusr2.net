# Now

I haven't written much in the way of "blog" posts, and for stupid
reasons such as technology. It turns out my "primary" computing
device, an iPad, doesn't make it easy to update this site given
it's a set shell scripts, markdown files, and rsync. Luckily, there
are a few different fixes:

* Not have a site at all. (Which I'm unlikely to do)
* Stop updating at all. (Which is what I've been doing)
* Make git the source of truth and build it from git. (What I should do)

In other news, 2025 came and I have some 
["Don't Break the Chain"](https://todoist.com/inspiration/dont-break-the-chain)
goals, which has led to me wanting a basic app for tracking this stuff. I
already had a need for a little custom tracking app, and I think I can
shoehorn "chains" into it easily enough. The only problem is that the
app is non-inspiring to write, and I'm too curmudgeonly to let an LLM
build it...

[Underploy](/metacircular-static-types.html) sort of took a back seat
in spare time computing projects, and a conversation at
[work](https://strongdm.com) sparked my interest in compiling to Go,
again. Long ago, I played with compiling Scheme to Go, and it was too
ambitious compared to my interest level. I fear this new idea will
have the same fate...

Doing my best to get better at sketching, write down more of my thoughts,
take more photos, and compile "social media" into a singular place... here. 

## Now-ish

2024 sparked an obsession with linocut. Still hoping to carve and print
a Mickey Mouse piece that I drew.

[Underploy](/metacircular-static-types.html) is going well and I've
identified a number of ways to meet my goal of really small, but useful as
a bootstrapping language. And by bootstrapping, I don't mean "OS," I really
mean bootstrapping projects written in Underploy that requires only a C 
compiler, rather than some other interpreted language. My efforts to play
around with SML solidified this need.
