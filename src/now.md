# Now

I stopped drawing daily, and I ran out of immediate ideas for tech-no
"gag cartoons." I'd like to get back into the "regular" drawing habit,
but without a clear goal, that's been harder to motivate.

Finished watching seasons 1 and 2 of "Spy Family" with my
daughter. Started "Komi Can't Communicate" with her. 

Started watching season 1 of Pantheon, which is good so far.

Still hoping to write more, and build more of a portfolio. Would also
like to put more "artistic" stuff, gag cartoons, stories, on another
domain.

_2025-02-18_: I never got around to building out this app. I have kept one streak alive, 
and the other one is dead.

_2025-02-18_: I wrote a very basic statically typed language and compiled it to Go.
It sparked my interest in exploring something bigger, though the increased scope
is making it harder to stay motivated on it. I should probably take a different
approach to this once more.

## Now-ish

2024 sparked an obsession with linocut. Still hoping to carve and print
a Mickey Mouse piece that I drew.

[Underploy](/metacircular-static-types.html) is going well and I've
identified a number of ways to meet my goal of really small, but useful as
a bootstrapping language. And by bootstrapping, I don't mean "OS," I really
mean bootstrapping projects written in Underploy that requires only a C 
compiler, rather than some other interpreted language. My efforts to play
around with SML solidified this need.
